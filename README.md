# Barista Training Web App

This Flask-based web application was developed as a final project for a university-level User Interface Design course. It provides a guided learning experience on coffee drink categories through interactive lessons and quizzes. The app includes both front-end and back-end features, enabling users to explore drink components, complete learning modules, and take various quiz formats such as multiple choice and drag-and-drop.

## Key Features

- Interactive multi-page UI built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend lesson and quiz tracking with dynamic state updates via AJAX
- Custom navigation logic that locks progression until learning objectives are completed
- Modular quiz support including image-based and text-based questions

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Backend**: Flask, Python, routing, user state tracking
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, templating with Jinja2
- **Project Structure**: Clear separation of static assets (JS/CSS/media) and templates (HTML), reusable components for quizzes and lessons
- **Collaboration**: Built in partnership with Kareem DaCosta, Helen Wang, and Jordyn Kim
